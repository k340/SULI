"""This script takes trigger data from text files with 6 columns,
    obtains dec, ra, tstarts, tstops, and counts,
    and eliminates overlapping regions based on which is more significant,
    returning a text file with the result.
    The assumption is that when overlapping regions trigger simultaneously,
    they are triggering on the same event;
    this script chooses the most significant trigger and removes duplicate detections.
    Significance is determined primarily by number of time bins in a specified area of sky,
    and secondarily by the count rate in the highest count-density bin"""
